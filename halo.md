## What is HAL0?

HAL0 is Pakistan's and possibly the world's first comprehensive geo-listening intelligence platform, purpose-built for multi-branch banking operations. Unlike generic social listening tools that provide surface-level insights, HAL0 dives into retail branching ecosystem to enable granular, actionable intelligence for every branch, every service, and every customer touchpoint across HBL's 1,720+ locations spanning across the entire country.

HAL0 gives **YOU** complete visibility into customer experience performance across all branches. By converting scattered complaints into strategic insights, HAL0 enables data-driven decisions that improve customer retention, reduce operational inefficiencies, and strengthen your competitive position in Pakistan's banking market to beat your competitors branch by branch.

## PROBLEMS!?

Every day, HBL customers across Pakistan voice their frustrations, praise exceptional service, and make switching decisions based on their branch experiences. Yet this critical intelligence remains scattered across online, invisible to the very executives who need it most. While competitors gain ground and customer deposits migrate, HBL's leadership operates with a dangerous blind spot: the inability to see, measure, and act on the real-time customer issues, suggestions, and, praises that drives business outcomes at each of their 1,720+ branches.

**How does HBL know what issues customers have faced at each of their 1720+ branches spanning all across Pakistan over a decade and still are?**

**Does HBL know what consistent issues in each branch leads to negative branch advocacy, social media uproar, customer switching intent and lost deposits over time?**

**How does HBL ensure branch-level accountability when customer complaints remain invisible to the executives who set performance standards?**

### Customer Feedback Examples:

**Owais Siddqui** - *3 months ago, F-11 Islamabad*
> "Worst branch ever!! Arshad Khalil - Branch Operation Manager - F-11 Islamabad, is such a rude person. Who doesn't know the meaning of Customer Support, Customer service and customer satisfaction. Please educate your staff. Instead of accommodating the customer he is directly closing account without any notice."

**Nasir Mehmood** - *A week ago, Rizvia Society, Karachi*
> "Worst HBL branch.. Let me tell you why. First of all only one counter is operating making customers wait for longer. Even in rush hours they are operating from only one counter, a single man handling every transaction and process. Secondly every time I visited they said 'Online nhi chal Raha'. It always frustrating to wait hours just to know 'online nhi chal Raha'. Pathetic. Worst customer service, untrained and unprofessional staff. Never expected this from HBL. Really disappointed here.. I have faced it so many time and still they do the same."

**Muhammad Ali** - *4 days ago, HBL Bank Main Boulevard Gulberg, Lahore*
> "Went to HBL to open an IT Service Export account. First visit: 'Please apply online' Online didn't work Second visit: 'Account staff not available, come back in 3 days' Ironically, they're happy to open a Prestige account if I insist. Guess exporting IT services isn't prestigious enough. ðŸ˜…"

**Muhammad Abu Bakr** - *3 months ago, Madina Town, Faisalabad*
> "This is one of the worst branches in town. The staff is incredibly rude and has no idea how to talk to customers, use language that's completely unacceptable. I tried to transfer money from Dubai to my account, but they refused, claiming my account was closed. They told me to deposit 5,000 rupees at the counter, fill out an application, and wait 20 days for my account to be reactivated before I could get my money. How am I supposed to take care of my urgent needs now? This is the last time I'll ever use HBL. I've been a customer for 8 years and have a strong statement with this branch. I'm completely disappointed."

## How would HAL0 help HBL?

### 01 - Strategic Portfolio Optimization
HAL0 transforms multi-million dollar branch network investments from guesswork into precision targeting. Executives gain real-time visibility into which branches drive customer acquisition versus those hemorrhaging deposits, enabling data-driven decisions on closures, expansions, and capital reallocation across the entire network.

### 02 - COMPETITIVE MARKET POSITIONING
When competitors establish presence in your catchment areas, HAL0 provides immediate intelligence on their service gaps and customer acquisition strategies. Executives can launch targeted counter-strategies, capitalize on competitor weaknesses, and defend market share with surgical precision rather than resource-draining reactive measures.

### 03 - OPERATIONAL RISK MITIGATION
HAL0's escalation prediction enables executives to intervene in branch-level issues before they escalate to regulatory scrutiny, media attention, or viral social media crises. This proactive approach protects institutional reputation and prevents operational failures from becoming board-level disasters that impact stakeholder confidence.

### 04 - PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK
The platform eliminates information asymmetry between branch-level reporting and customer reality, giving executives objective performance metrics that correlate directly with business outcomes. This enables evidence-based leadership decisions and ensures accountability across the management hierarchy through measurable customer experience indicators.

**For executives HAL0 means making decisions based on customer reality rather than internal reports - transforming reactive management into proactive leadership.**
